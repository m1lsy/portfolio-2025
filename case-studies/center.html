              <div class="rich-text">
                <p>In this project, my team and I collaborated with our client Studio Krom, an innovative design and technology studio based in Eindhoven, to help make the digital world more accessible and inclusive.</p>
              </div>
            </section>

            <section class="content-section">
              <h2 class="section-label">Challenge</h2>
              <div class="rich-text">
                <p>Accessibility is a broad and multifaceted topic, offering countless directions to explore. As a team, we quickly realized that trying to tackle the entire umbrella of accessibility would be overwhelming and difficult. We wanted to narrow it down to an aspect that felt personally relevant and potentially overlooked in mainstream conversations.</p>
                <p>This led us to focus on ADHD - a condition that affects many people in our age group and immediate circles. Despite its prevalence, ADHD is often underrepresented in discussions around digital accessibility, making it a meaningful and impactful area for us to explore together with Studio Krom.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
              <h2 class="section-label">Research Process</h2>
              <div class="rich-text">
                <p>To kick off our project, we conducted library research alongside a series of interviews with individuals who have ADHD. Our goal was to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and the challenges they face—especially in relation to digital accessibility.</p>
                
                <h3>Research Challenges</h3>
                <p>To find participants for our interviews, I reached out to several sources:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Contacted Student+ at Fontys (limited by privacy policies)</li>
                  <li>Posted in relevant Reddit forums (removed by moderators)</li>
                  <li>Reached out to ADHD Café in Eindhoven</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Despite these setbacks, I was still able to connect with individuals from my own network who were open to sharing their experiences.</p>

                  "If I see everything on the screen at once, it's an overload—I start bouncing from one thing to the next. But if I can choose what I want to see, I can focus better. Out of sight, out of mind works both ways for me."

              <h2 class="section-label">Key Findings</h2>
              <div class="rich-text">
                <p>Through my research, I discovered that individuals with ADHD often experience:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Heightened sensitivity to visual stimuli</li>
                  <li>Feelings of overwhelm in cluttered digital environments</li>
                  <li>Development of personal coping mechanisms</li>
                  <li>Need for specialized tools for organization and focus</li>

                <h3>1. Initial Concept Development</h3>
                <p>We began with mood boards and visual research to establish the design direction for our extension:</p>

                </figure>

                <h3>2. Wireframing & Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
                <p>We explored various layouts and interaction patterns through wireframes:</p>

                <h3>3. Interface Iterations</h3>
                <p>Based on user feedback and client input, we refined the interface design:</p>

                </figure>

                <h3>4. Final Design</h3>
                <p>Our final interface design prioritized simplicity and focus:</p>

                </figure>

                <h3>5. Project Communication</h3>
                <p>We developed a series of posters to raise awareness about digital accessibility and showcase our product:</p>

                </figure>

                <p>These posters helped communicate our vision to stakeholders and explain how Center addresses digital accessibility challenges for users with ADHD.</p>

                  "I found your presentation to be very professional... All of the features you proposed were strong, but my advice is to focus on the web page condenser and the Pomodoro timer. Keep in mind the 'Swiss Army Knife Complex': sometimes having too many features can dilute the impact."

                <p>For the development phase, we focused on quality over quantity, choosing to implement two core features thoroughly rather than multiple features superficially. I worked with my teammate Yurick on the timer feature, including both styling and functionality.</p>
                
                <p>Key technical challenges included:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>First experience with React framework</li>
                  <li>Collaborative development workflows</li>
                  <li>Git version control</li>
                  <li>Browser extension architecture</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The final implementation included:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Functional stopwatch component</li>
                  <li>Pomodoro timer with customizable settings</li>

              <div class="rich-text">
                <p>We conducted extensive user testing to validate our design decisions:</p>

              <div class="rich-text">
                <p>The project culminated in winning the award for Best Digital Accessibility Concept during the final demo presentations.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>This success was driven by:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Strong team collaboration with minimal conflicts</li>
                  <li>Excellent client relationship with Studio Krom</li>
                  <li>Regular feedback sessions and iterations</li>
                  <li>Focus on quality over feature quantity</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project was particularly meaningful as it created a tool that continues to be useful beyond the academic context. The extension successfully helps users with ADHD navigate digital spaces more effectively while maintaining focus and productivity.</p>
